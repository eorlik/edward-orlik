I'm Eddie Orlik. I am a designer and maker living in West Dorset, where I spend most of my time as the technical designer for <a href="https:/www.jesswheeler.com"/>Jess Wheeler Studio</a>. Until Autumn 2024, I spent the best part of a decade living in my beloved Camberwell, London, and working in policy and strategy jobs in the UK government.

You can find a selection of my creative work and personal projects here, including pieces of furniture, websites, posters, paintings, sculpture, clothing, hand-bound books and architectural designs.
